Summary
I am a driven Senior Chemical and Biological Engineering Student
at RPI pursuing a bachelors degree. I am currently doing a Co-Op at
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals under Dr. Gorgi Pavlov in Formulation
Development exploring scale-down models, fluid flows, and protein
aggregation properties. During this time I have refined both my wet-
lab skills as well as programming and simulation skills as we seek to
holistically analyze systems. (patent pending)
I have also done work in Dr. Georges Belfort’s research group
using molecular dynamics simulations to investigate A-beta
peptide’s interactions with various cell receptors to help uncover
the mechanism of neurotoxicity in Alzheimer’s Disease. This study
involved traditional MD simulations of proteins on GROMACs as
well as analysis of a previous students docking simulation data.
(manuscript in progress).
I am currently looking to pursue a PhD, doing research in biological
nanotechnology pertaining to custom/designer molecules,
nanostructures, and the overall development of how we can use
basic biological subunits to fit nearly any application and solve
incredible problems.
