CRO Developer
Portland, Oregon, United States
Summary
I enjoy patterns and value novelty—this makes me an excellent
problem solver. With help from years spent as a multi-
instrumentalist, I have developed a good ability to apply abstract
models in new contexts—particularly transferrable to coding I’ve
found! Every week I’m working on UX and conversion improvements
for several e-commerce sites through testing and analysis and in my
free time you’ll find me studying up on more coding and analytics or
playing music (mandolin, bass, fiddle, piano and pennywhistle lately).
I have developed over 250 A/B tests with more on the way.
Skills: A/B testing, JavaScript, front end development, Google
Analytics, UX
