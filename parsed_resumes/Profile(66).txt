Lindsey Halman
Executive Director at UP for Learning
Greater Burlington Area
Summary
A passionate leader and committed change-maker, Lindsey Halman
is the Executive Director of UP for Learning. She is committed to
exploring radically inclusive education and multiple ways of knowing.
She believes there is no more compelling time than right now to
ask, "how do I meet this moment with courage, vulnerability, and
creativity?" She joined the UP team in 2018 after 15 years as a
middle level educator, leader and advocate. Prior to joining UP,
she co-founded The Edge Academy at Essex Middle School. The
Edge Academy served as a model and learning laboratory for many
educators throughout Vermont, and beyond. The Edge integrated
education for sustainability, as well as the arts, into all aspects of
the team and curriculum. At the Edge Academy, there was a strong
focus on youth voice, social justice, student-centered learning,
project-based learning, and negotiated curriculum. Lindsey is
passionate about building strong relationships with youth and adults,
helping them feel empowered to make change, and creating a
socially just climate and culture for all. When not rigorously pursuing
social change in education, she can be found spending time with her
family, taking dance classes, gardening, dreaming about flowers,
reading, and loving the outdoor activities that every season brings to
Vermont.
