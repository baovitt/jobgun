Summary
As a fund manager at The Cayuga Fund, I apply my data analytics
and business strategy skills to manage a student-run investment
fund for Cornell's endowment. I am also a student fellow at Cornell
Emerging Markets Institute, where I conduct research on the role
of emerging markets in the global economy. Additionally, I was a
summer associate at Azaí Consultores, a leading consulting firm in
Latin America, where I worked on business development, pricing
strategies, and project management. I am currently pursuing an
MBA degree at Cornell Johnson Graduate School of Management,
with a focus on finance and emerging markets. I have a BS degree
in Business Administration and Management Information Systems
from Fowler College of Business at San Diego State University. I
have over seven years of experience as a senior data scientist and
business strategist at Blizzard Entertainment, where I contributed
to the development and success of multiple data products and
games, such as World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, and Starcraft 2. I
am passionate about using data and technology to create value and
impact in the world of finance, gaming, and entertainment.
