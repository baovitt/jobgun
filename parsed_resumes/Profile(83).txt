Summary
As the Manager of Instruction at Rightworks, I lead the design and
delivery of strategic, innovative, and engaging courses and curricula
for accounting firm leaders and teams nationwide. With over 15
years of experience in education, leadership, public speaking, and
psychology, I have developed a diverse and distinctive skill set that
enables me to empower business owners and their staff to achieve
their full potential and find fulfillment in their work.
I'm deeply passionate about promoting equitable and efficient
workplaces where everyone thrives. I have been actively involved
in advocating for social justice initiatives and Diversity, Equity,
and Inclusion (DEI) in both educational and professional settings.
Earning my Professional Certificate in Supervisory Management
from Michigan State University has enhanced my ability to coach
and mentor others in developing their leadership and management
skills while managing effective and successful teams. I believe that
every challenge and opportunity in life offers a chance for growth
and transformation, and I'm committed to sharing my insights and
expertise with others who share this vision.
