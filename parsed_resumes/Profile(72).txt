Lindsay Semler
Senior Staff Engineer at The TJX Companies, Inc.
Greater Chicago Area
Summary
I have a BS in Computer Graphics and Animation Development,
Physics Engineering, Visual Computing & MS in Software
Engineering. I have worked in a multitude of different disciplines
such as: Gaming, Medical Imaging, Computer Graphics, Educational
Apps, AI, and Mobile (iOS, Android & Xamarin), and R&D.
I am a Full Stack Engineer, with experience in 3 years of Medical
Research, 5 years of Graphics Research, 4 years of Embedded,
4 years of Web, and 10+ years of Mobile engineering. At Wheels,
I worked with Xamarin, Azure, Google Cloud, and SQL. There I
engineered mobile development and R&D. At Everi, I was Lead
engineer  and hiring manager for the Chicago office consisting of two
teams for Engineers, Artists, Math Engineers, Producers and Game
Designers. At AMI Entertainment, I jumped on several projects
simultaneously, providing support for Game Development, Database
rearchitecture, while completing my responsibilities as the sole iOS
engineer. I have been a lead for a Unity iOS team of 5 engineers
and 3 artists at TinyBop to create an educational app for children.
At WMS, I engineered over 60 games from initial conception all the
way through Product Assurance. I created new feature libraries,
new functionality to the framework, and developed new tools for
engineers, artists, designers, and product assurance. I initiated a
new system for due diligence, agile development, and code and
design reviews.
I have a significant amount of experience with innovative cutting-
edge research. I algorithmically classified organs from CT scans
using image processing. I was the first engineer in the world to
engineer Curvelets for texture analysis. I pioneered multi-texture
analysis techniques, such as Wavelets, Ridgelets,
And Curvelets in image processing. In my computer graphics
research, I automated 3D animations algorithmically of the human
body movement for animated American Sign Language translations.

No One is Hopeless! One Alcoholic's
Journey from Despair to Sobriety
I am disciplined and imaginative, always striving to improve myself
as an engineer. I am capable of analyzing complex problems,
investigating alternatives and providing concrete, well-thought-out
solutions. I have considerable and varied experiences, am self-
motivated, and an expert with multi-tasking. I consider myself a life-
long learner always looking for a new challenge.
