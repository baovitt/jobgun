Our community boasts a resort-style swimming pool, 24-hour gym, fire pit lounge, sand volleyball court, and dog park for our residents! We also have 528 rooms that need to be leased each and every year. And we are looking for someone to help us do just that. The main focus of this position revolves around sales and customer service. Not only are you assisting the residents that are currently here, you’re helping us to find & sign new residents for the year to come. Being an outgoing and resilient self starter is a requirement, relevant sales experience is just a bonus!\n\n\nIn this position, you are in control of your income! We have designed our pay structure to attract, motivate, and retain talented employees who are highly engaged with our business and our customers.\n• Our competitive hourly wage provides team members with stable and dependable income year round.\n• Agent commissions offer an opportunity to directly influence your earnings based on performance and results.\n• Team commissions are included to foster collaboration and a sense of camaraderie among coworkers.\n• Milestone bonuses were incorporated to provide direct monetary recognition to our team members that have made an impact within the company. \n\n\nWith all the bells and whistles of a 5 star resort, we wouldn’t blame you for thinking that leasing this property is easy. In fact, our signing season often starts out that way. Then as rates change, availability drops, and your customer pool gets smaller, things get a bit more challenging. Why are we telling you this? Simple; we value transparency.\n\n\n• Would you have access to our benefits and compensation packages? Yes.\n• Would you develop extensive sales and marketing experience? Yes.\n• Would you be provided training and support from every level of our company? Yes.\nBut…\n• Would you have to answer calls from exasperated residents? Also yes.\n• Would you have to respond to an occasional after hours lock out? Also yes.\n• Would you be pushed and challenged to hit your leasing goal? Absolutely yes.\n\n\nWe want to paint a clear picture of what being a Leasing Specialist at PHILLIPS Management is like so that you can give full consideration when you go to make your next career decision.\n\n\nSample Day in the Life:\n• Events: Contact residents inviting them to our event! Encourage them to bring a friend who is thinking about living at our community. Post on Social Media to bring awareness to the event and increase attendance. Help set up and take down the event. Meet and greet residents and guests. Build connections so you can connect with them later!\n• Hospitality: Answer the phone & greet residents who come into our office. Check in on the pool - Greet residents, confirm everyone there has an amenity band and hand out some popsicles. Log incoming packages and assist residents.\n• Outreach: Post on our Instagram page and respond to any DM’s. Find and follow newly signed residents on social media. Post about events going on in the community.\n• Sales: Reach out to people looking for housing/roommates on Facebook. Contact any leads that haven’t shown a lot of activity recently. Follow up with a Guarantor who has some questions about the lease prior to signing. If you have time, head to campus to do some prospecting!\n\n\nLooking for career growth?\nOver 75% of our current supervisors and/or managers have been promoted from within. If this is something you’re interested in, ask about our Manager-In-Training Program! We can provide you with skills and opportunities you need to become an excellent leader. Want to test the waters first? No problem. Promoting from within is our bread and butter. Current team members at PHILLIPS Management have access to an internal application where they express their desire to grow within the company. Even if they aren’t sure what they want to be doing or when, this application still gives them the ability to raise their hand and say “I want to grow!”\n\n\nWhat about benefits? \nWe believe you do your best work when you feel your best. Our benefits package reflects this sentiment as well. \n\n\nWe offer:\n• 15 paid holidays for Full-Time team members\n• Flexible Time Off\n• Vacation: minimum 2 weeks/10 days each year for Full-Time Team members\n• Sick: minimum 2 weeks/10 days each year for Full-Time Team members\n• Full Medical, Dental and Vision Insurance\n• PHILLIPS covers 100% of your medical insurance costs for our Full-Time team members\n• Partner/Family enrollment options available\n• Monthly rental discounts for team members living on property ranging from 20-100%\n• SimpleIRA Plan with a 3% match at 1 year of employment for Full-Time team members\n• Paid Parental Leave (Maternity and Paternity Leave options available)\n• Reimbursement for approved learning and development courses\n• Guaranteed Minimum Hours - 20 hours/week for Part-Time, 40 hours/week for Full-Time\n\n\nAbout PHILLIPS Management and Progress 910\nProgress 910 is owned and operated by a couple of brothers whose goal is to see you succeed. We truly want our employees to be just as happy and satisfied as our residents which is why we didn’t want a run of the mill ad listing requirements, competencies, objectives, expectations, blah blah blah. We are looking for someone who can add to the culture here. Go to our website (www.Progress910.com). Come visit the clubhouse. Everywhere you look the message is that we Live Different. Not just the residents but the employees too. We seek out people who we think could pick up what we’re putting down. Someone that doesn’t meet expectations but exceeds them. Not because they feel like they have to but because they want to. We don’t stop until we’re proud. And we’re looking for people who feel the same.\n\n\nThe job requirements are pretty straightforward. What’s difficult is finding someone with the corresponding work ethic. And to make this role even harder to fill… we prefer to hire people that make us smile. Because if you’re going to be spending at least 40 hours of your week here, might as well spend it smiling.
